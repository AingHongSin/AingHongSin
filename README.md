# Hey there 👋, I’m Aing Hongsin  

🚀 *iOS Developer • Builder • Problem Solver*  

I craft **apps that people actually use** — simple, clean, and impactful.  
From **Pomodoro timers** in Cambodia to **Khmer-language AI models**, I love turning my stupid ideas into products that make life easier (and sometimes more fun).
